Problem fixed: Using ItemArray
	the current list creator uses item details
	item details
		item name
		item image
	The problem is that names and images are manually entered through serialized fields in unity
	
	I need for the names and images to always be associated with eachother through two similarly indexed arrays
		name = 		{1		2		...}
		sprite = 	{battery_DU	Battery_UD	...}



After that, we use LevelSettings with an activation bool list
	AllowedSprites = 1010010100100100111101010011...
	If there's a one at that index, then allow that sprite to be used and put it in the list

	I also want LevelSettings to be automatically loaded instead of entered in the editor
	I think I can associate the LevelSettings using an ID


The ListCreator uses a serializedfield for number of items, which is manually entered
	it should be the number of 1s in the bitmap for AllowedSprites


Community mode doesn't make a new scene for every level, it just loads the levelsettings to be used
